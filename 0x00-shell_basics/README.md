# Basic Shell Commands

## What is "the Shell"?
The shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform.

*How It Works:*

**You Speak:** You type out commands on your keyboard.
**Shell Listens:** The shell pays attention to what you say.
**It Delivers:** The shell takes your words and hands them over to the computer's big decision-maker (the operating system) to get things done.
